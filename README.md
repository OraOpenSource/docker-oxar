# docker-oxar

_Future home for a docker implementation of [OXAR](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/OXAR). This project is still under development_

The goal of this project is to create an install script to end up with docker implementations of:

- Oracle XE 18c
  - APEX installed
  - Logger
  - Initial user
  - Sample `emp` and `dept`
- ORDS
- [SUEZ](https://github.com/fuzziebrain/suez)
  - This will be to get around 

Until this project has an initial working copy you can use the following docker scripts for:

- [Oracle XE 18c](https://github.com/fuzziebrain/docker-oracle-xe)
  - [Install APEX](https://github.com/fuzziebrain/docker-oracle-xe/blob/master/docs/apex-install.md)
- [ORDS](https://github.com/martindsouza/docker-ords)
